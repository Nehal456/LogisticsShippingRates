Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to creating an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone, and to providing a safe space for collaboration.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language.
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
Focusing on what is best for the community.
Showing empathy towards other community members.
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
Public or private harassment.
Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are 
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to
temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include the repository, forums, or other channels.


Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
the project team at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and
will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face
temporary or permanent repercussions.
